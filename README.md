Floyd Warshall Algorithm in Recursion: 

This project was designed to convert imperative Python to a recursive function. This project has created two recursive functions, they include shortes_pathway
and floyd(distance), to create the single shortest path between nodes. 

Table of contents:
 - Iterative Source Code (imperative Python)
 - Recursive Code (Recursive Python)
 - speed_testing (comparative testing)
 - testing (general testing)
 - dependencies.txt
 
 Tests:
  - speed_testing used timeit module to test imperative vs recursive Python, and both the shortest_pathway and floyd(distance) functions. 
  
  How to use the project?
  - Install packages and additional modules that are available on dependencies.txt
  - Use source code from recursive code to product matrix graph
